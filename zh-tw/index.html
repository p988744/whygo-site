                                    Hello, my name is Angela, I got 98 on my TOEFL test on 23 Jan, 2010. I started my class with Steven at Whygo about four month ago and I came here about twice a week. I think I really learned a lot from Steven who is a wonderful teacher. He pointed out my bad writing habits after reading only one or maybe two of my writing and then we worked together to get rid of these bad writing habits. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After plenty of practices, my writing skill progressed so much and allowed me to score 25 in my TOEFL test. It felt like a dream comes true, a grade that I can't ever believe that I've got it, and I attribute this high score to Steven's teaching. Also, he uses a creative way to help me improve my speaking skill. We always do a lot of interesting practice which not only push me to think and speak English at the same time without hesitation but also help me defeat the fear toward speaking section in TOEFL test. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because of his teaching, I enjoyed my class over there, sometimes I even felt like becoming a foreigner at Whygo. After practicing speaking English with Steven for four month, I got 23 on my speaking section on TOEFL test. Steven is a wonderful teacher that teaches you English and amazing test skills, he is the person you are looking for if you want to boost your test grades, come and have classes with him, you will have a great harvest like I did.
                                </p>

                                    When I decided to prepare for IELTS test, I went to a "business" cram school. The teacher was very popular, as well as good at teaching, so there were always more than 30 students in one class.
                                Therefore, the teacher did not have enough time to answer everyone's question, not to mention to discuss students' articles with them. Finally, I just got 5.5 in the end of six-month course and that situation really frustrated me. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, I came to WHYGO few months later because the popular teacher also worked there and told me it was a good school. The atmosphere was warm and fragrant; moreover, they allowed students studying there all day which made it different from other schools.First of all, Steven checked my articles which were awful and hard to understand. Then we made a study plan, and I went there to practice writing almost every day. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Steven corrected all of my articles patiently.Nevertheless, I joined several small classes so as to learn from each other. Under the English environment, my speaking improved rapidly. Lastly, I got 7.0 on IELTS test within 2 months! This was a great English- learning experience.
                                </p>

                                    I have been studied the business course at Whygo for 4 months. Why I choose Whygo to learn English is I couldn't stand at the cram school, which has many students in the classroom. Whygo has limited number in one class, so I got much chance to speaking English with teacher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since my job function is needed to communicate with the oversea customers by using email and telephone, I enrolled in the business class at Whygo. As we know the words and expression in commercial are different with regular writing, so Steven taught me how to write the commercial email to customers properly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I sometimes would take the emails to Steven who would check them to me immediately.Thus, I can figure out what mistake I made and I have improved in writing commercial email.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Furthermore, I learned the way to do formal presentation as well. During the business class, my classmates and I usually do the presentation in severaltopics.The teacher would point our weakness out and corrects the mistake while we mispronounce and grammar as well. Therefore, we could make the improvement in presentation skills by practicing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Learning English at Whygo is such interesting and useful. I really appreciated Steven help me to improve the writing and speaking in business communication a lot.
                                </p>

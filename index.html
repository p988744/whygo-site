    								<p>Hello, my name is Angela; I got a 98 on my TOEFL test on 23 January 2010. I started classes with Steven at the WhyGo Language Center about 4 months ago and I came here about twice a week.</p>
    								<p>I think I really learned a lot from Steven who is a wonderful teacher. He pointed out my bad writing habits after reading only one or maybe two of my writing tasks and then we worked together to get rid of these bad writing habits. </p>
    								<p>After plenty of practice, my writing skills progressed a lot and this allowed me to score 25 (for writing) in my TOEFL test. I felt like a dream had come true, with a grade that I could never have believed that I would have got. I attribute this high score to Steven’s teaching. He also used many creative ways to help me improve my speaking skills. We always practiced in many different interesting ways, which not only pushed me to think and speak English at the same time without hesitation but also helped me defeat my fear of speaking in TOEFL test. </p>

    								<p>When I decided to prepare for the IELTS test, I went to a business cram school with a very famous teacher. However, there were always more than 30 students in one classroom and the teacher did not have enough time to answer everyone’s questions. Having studied for 6 months, I only got a 5.5 for my IELTS test, which really frustrated me.</p>
    								<p>However, I came to WhyGo a few months later and I only needed to study there for 2 months. The atmosphere in the school was warm and fragrant; moreover, they allowed students to study there all day, which made it different from other language schools. The teachers had more than enough time to answer my questions and my English improved rapidly. Within 2 months I got a 7.0 for my IELTS test and had a great English learning experience.</p>
